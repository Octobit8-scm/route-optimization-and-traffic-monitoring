# route-optimization-and-traffic-monitoring
## Objective
To visualize and analyze traffic data to help optimize delivery routes, predict delays, and improve overall fleet management. By doing so, logistics companies can ensure timely deliveries, reduce fuel costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
## Implementation
1.	Data Source
 - GPS data from vehicles (e.g., vehicle coordinates).
 - Real-time traffic data (via APIs like Google Maps or Traffic API).
 - Route details such as start/end points, distance, and time taken.
2.	Libraries Used
 - Folium: For creating interactive maps and visualizing geospatial data such as routes and traffic congestion.
 - Matplotlib/Seaborn: For analyzing traffic patterns, delivery performance over time, and visualizing trends.
3.	Types of Visualizations
 - Geospatial Maps: Display route data and traffic conditions using interactive maps.
 - Heatmaps: Show congestion levels along routes or within cities, helping to identify traffic hotspots.
 - Time-Series Charts: Monitor delivery performance over time, identifying delays and inefficiencies.
## Expected Outcome
By following the implementation steps, transportation and logistics companies can:
 - Visualize delivery routes and identify traffic congestion hotspots.
 - Optimize routes to reduce delivery times and fuel costs.
 - Track delivery performance and identify areas for improvement.
